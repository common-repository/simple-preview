== Description ==

Let anonymous users preview a post before it is published!

Have you ever been writing a post that needs to be reviewed by someone who does not have access to log in? This plugin generates a simple URL that can be given out for public preview.

Based on Public Post Preview 1.3 by Matt Martz and Jonathan Dingman. Unlike Public Post Preview, the Simple Preview can be accessed by more then one user. The 24hr  time limit has also been removed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this different then Public Post Preview? =

1. Completely removed the use of "nonce" variable. Posts marked preview are now accessible by multiple anonymous users. There is no longer a 24hr time limit.

1. Public_Post_Preview used the option variable as an array to store preview state - genius! However, it's use seemed backwards with an empty item == preview true. This logic was reversed so: simple_array[,,true,,true] now means that p=1 and p=4 have previews. This also allows for the preview to be turned off by default. 		

1. Removed extra variables for a cleaner URI: http://www.yourblog.com/?p=1502&preview=true

= How do I use it? =
1. Unlike public post preview, simple preview is not turned on by default. 

1. To enable simple preview for a specific post, check 'Allow Preview' and save the post. A simple URL will be created.

1. To disable, uncheck the box and save the post again
